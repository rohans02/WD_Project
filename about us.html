                <p>Com.interest originated from the idea that there exists a class of readers who respond better to online 
                   content and prefer to learn new skills at their own pace from the comforts of their drawing rooms.

                   The journey commenced with a single tutorial on HTML in 2006 and elated by the response it generated, 
                    we worked our way to adding fresh tutorials to our repository which now proudly flaunts a wealth of tutorials 
                   and allied articles on topics ranging from programming languages to web designing to academics and much more.</p>
