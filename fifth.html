<h2 class="texth2">FIFTH GENERATION COMPUTERS...!!</h2>

<ol class="text">
<li>The period of fifth generation is 1980-till date.</li>
<li>In the fifth generation, VLSI technology became ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration) technology, resulting in the production of microprocessor chips having ten million electronic components.</li>
This generation is based on parallel processing hardware and AI (Artificial Intelligence) software. </li>
<li>AI is an emerging branch in computer science, which interprets the means and method of making computers think like human beings.</li> 
<li>All the high-level languages like C and C++, Java, .Net etc., are used in this generation. </li>
<li>
Eg. Desktop, Laptop, Notebook, Chromebook, etc.
</li>
