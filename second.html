<h2 class="texth2">SECOND GENERATION COMPUTERS...!!</h2>

<ol class="text">
<li>The period of second generation was from 1959-1965.</li>
<li>In this generation, transistors were used that were cheaper, consumed less power, more compact in size, more reliable and faster than the first-generation machines made of vacuum tubes.</li>
<li>In this generation, magnetic cores were used as the primary memory and magnetic tape and magnetic disks as secondary storage devices.</li>
<li>In this generation, assembly language and high-level programming languages like FORTRAN, COBOL were used.</li>
<li>The computers used batch processing and multiprogramming operating system.</li>
<li>Eg. <abbr title="International Business Machines Corporation">IBM</abbr>-1620,
        <abbr title="International Business Machines Corporation">IBM</abbr>-7094,
        <abbr title="Control Data Corporation">CDC</abbr>-1604, 
        <abbr title="Control Data Corporation">CDC</abbr>-3600, 
        <abbr title=" Universal Automatic Computer">UNIVAC</abbr>-1108, etc.</li>

<h3 class="texth3">Advantages :</h3>
<ul class="text">
<li>The size of these computers reduced considerably.</li>
<li>They were very fast as compared to first generation computers.</li>
<li>Computers of these generation were very much reliable than that of first generation computers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="texth3">Disadvantages :</h3>
<ul class="text">
<li>The computers of these generation got over heated quickly.</li>
<li>Also these types of computers had a maintenance problem.</li>
</ul>
