<h2 class="texth2">FOURTH GENERATION COMPUTERS...!!</h2>

<ol class="text">
<li>The period of fourth generation was from 1971-1980. 
<li>Computers of fourth generation used Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits. </li>
<li>VLSI circuits having about 5000 transistors and other circuit elements with their associated circuits on a single chip made it possible to have microcomputers of fourth generation.</li> <li>Fourth generation computers became more powerful, compact, reliable, and affordable. </li>
<li>As a result, it gave rise to Personal Computer (PC) revolution. </li>
<li>In this generation, time sharing, real time networks, distributed operating system were used. </li>
<li>All the high-level languages like C, C++, DBASE etc., were used in this generation.</li>

<li>
Eg. <abbr title="Digital Equipment Corporation">DEC</abbr>-10,
        <abbr title="Personal Data Processor">PDP</abbr>-11, 
         STAR 1000, CRAY-1(Super Computer), CRAY-X-MP(Super Computer), etc.
        </li>

<h3 class="texth3">Advantages :</h3>
<ul class="text">
<li>Computers of these generation produced very less amount of heat.</li>
<li>Also the computing speed was much faster tahn first computers.</li>
<li>There was less maintainance and hardware failure of these computers.</li>
<li>Also, these computers were easily portable.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="texth3">Disadvantages :</h3>
<ul class="text">
<li>There was a challenge faced in manufacturing the chips.</li>
</ul>
