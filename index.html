           <div class="character-col">
              <h3>Speed</h3>
               <p>A computer works with much higher speed and accuracy compared to humans<br> while performing mathematical calculations.</p>
                 
            </div>  
            <div class="character-col">  
                <h3>Automation</h3>
                <p>Computer performs all the tasks automatically i.e.<br> it performs tasks without manual intervention.</p>
                 
            </div>  
            <div class="character-col">  
               <h3>Accuracy</h3>
                <p>Computers perform calculations with 100% accuracy.<br> Errors may occur due to data inconsistency or inaccuracy.</p>
             </div> 
            <div class="character-col">  
               <h3>Versatility</h3>
                <p>Versatility refers to the capability of a computer<br> to perform different kinds of works with same accuracy and efficiency.</p>
             </div> 
            <div class="character-col">  
               <h3>Diligence</h3>
                <p>A computer can perform millions of tasks or calculations<br> with the same consistency and accuracy.</p>
             </div> 
            <div class="character-col">  
               <h3>Reliability</h3>
                <p>A computer is reliable as it gives consistent result for similar set of data i.e.,<br> if we give same set of input any number of times, we will get the same result.</p>
             </div>   
            <div class="character-col">  
               <h3>Memory</h3>
                <p>A computer has built-in memory called primary memory where it stores data. Secondary storage<br> are removable devices such as CDs, pen drives, etc.,                                          which are also used to store data.</p>
