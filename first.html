<h2 class="texth2">FIRST GENERATION COMPUTERS...!!</h2>

<ol class="text">
<li>The period of first generation was from 1946-1959.</li>
<li>The computers of first generation used vacuum tubes as the basic components for memory and circuitry for CPU (Central Processing Unit). </li>
<li>These tubes, like electric bulbs, produced a lot of heat and the installations used to fuse frequently. <br>Therefore, they were very expensive and only large organizations were able to afford it.</li>
<li>In this generation, mainly batch processing operating system was used. Punch cards, paper tape, and magnetic tape was used as input and output devices. </li>
<li>The computers in this generation used machine code as the programming language. </li>
<li>Eg. <abbr title="Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer">ENIAC</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer">EDVAC</abbr>,
        <abbr title=" Universal Automatic Computer">UNIVAC</abbr>,
        IBM-750, etc.</li>

<h3 class="texth3">Advantages :</h3>
<ul class="text">
<li>It was only electronic device at that period.</li>
<li> It was the first device to hold memory.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="texth3">Disadvantages :</h3>
<ul class="text">
<li>It was too bulky i.e large in size.</li>
<li>In these types of computers vacuum tubes burn frequently.</li>
<li>Theyse types of computers were producing alot of heat.</li>
<li>Computers of this generation had a frequent maintenance problems.</li>
</ul>
