<h2 class="texth2">THIRD GENERATION COMPUTERS...!!</h2>

<ol class="text">
<li>The period of third generation was from 1965-1971.</li>
<li>The computers of third generation used Integrated Circuits (IC's) in place of transistors.</li>
<li>A single IC has many transistors, resistors, and capacitors along with the associated circuitry. </li>  
<li>The IC was invented by Jack Kilby. This development made computers smaller in size, reliable, and efficient.</li> 
<li>In this generation remote processing, time-sharing, multi-programming operating system were used.</li> 
<li>High-level languages (FORTRAN-II TO IV, COBOL, PASCAL PL/1, BASIC, ALGOL-68 etc.) were used during this generation.</li>

<li>Eg. <abbr title="International Business Machines Corporation">IBM</abbr>-360 series,
        <abbr title="International Business Machines Corporation">IBM</abbr>-370/168,
        <abbr title="Personal Data Processor">PDP</abbr>, 
        Honeywell-6000 series, 
        <abbr title="Torpedo Data Computer">TDC</abbr>-316, etc.</li>

<h3 class="texth3">Advantages :</h3>
<ul class="text">
<li>ICs are very small in size as cpmpared to transistors.</li>
Also there was Improved performance of these types of computers.</li>
<li>Especially, the production cost was cheap as compared to first two generation of computers.</li>

</ul>

<h3 class="texth3">Disadvantages :</h3>
<ul class="text">
<li>These computers required air condition as they got heated up quickly.</li>
<li>ICs were also sophisticated.</li>
</ul>
